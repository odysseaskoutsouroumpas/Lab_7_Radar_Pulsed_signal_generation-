# Lab 7 â€“ Radar Pulsed Signal Generation

This repository demonstrates the process of generating radar pulsed signals using discrete-time techniques. Radar systems often rely on pulses of energy to detect objects by measuring the reflected signal. This lab covers the basics of pulse generation and signal processing used in radar systems.

## Contents

### Python Scripts:
- `pulse_generation.py`: Script to generate basic pulsed radar signals.
- `pulse_modulation.py`: Script to apply modulation techniques to radar pulses.
- `pulse_signal_plot.py`: Visualizes the radar pulse signal, showing time-domain and frequency-domain representations.

### Audio/Signal Files:
- `radar_pulse_signal.wav`: Example radar pulse signal saved as a `.wav` file for playback and analysis.
- `modulated_signal.wav`: Modulated radar pulse signal used for further analysis.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

To run the scripts and perform signal generation and analysis, you need the following Python libraries:

- **`numpy`** â€“ for numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **`matplotlib`** â€“ for visualizing signals in the time and frequency domains.
- **`scipy`** â€“ for signal processing functions and tools.
- **`soundfile`** â€“ for reading and saving `.wav` files.

To install all required libraries, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib soundfile
